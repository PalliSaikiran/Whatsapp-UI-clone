# WhatsApp UI Clone

This project is an interactive clone of the WhatsApp user interface built with only HTML, TailwindCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The app has light and dark mode features and can be changed by going to settings just like in your regular WhatsApp for desktop or mobile.


## Responsive Design

This WhatsApp UI clone is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices. The layout, elements, and components have been carefully crafted to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## Overview
This project is an interactive clone of the WhatsApp user interface built with only HTML, TailwindCSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Light and Dark themes
The app has light and dark mode features and can be changed by going to settings just like in your regular WhatsApp for desktop or mobile.
